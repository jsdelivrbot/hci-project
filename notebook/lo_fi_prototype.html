    <h2>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h2>

    <h3>Design Concepts</h3>
    <div>
        <p class="body_text">
            The <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=c-RAUXk3gbkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false">10+10 method</a> was applied to generate designs. The steps to reach a low-fidelity prototype are listed below. 
        </p>

        <h4>Step 1. State the design challenge</h4>
        <p class="body_text">
            First, we defined the main design challenge we were facing:
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
            The task is to design a mobile game that facilitates face-to-face social interaction in a group of people that know each other, all the while minimizing isolation when interacting with the app.
            <br>
            <br>
            In this context, the design challenge can be refined into two main components. The first one is to minimize the complexity and setup time of the game. This is to allow people to play as soon as possible, so they can spend less time isolated on their phone. The second one is more complex to achieve, because it’s about using the phone to get people off of their phone. While building the game component of the application, it must be simple enough so that the users can easily go through the game while having social interaction with others. Also, it should encourage social interaction by enticing players to interact with each other to achieve their goal in the game.
        </p>

        <h4>Step 2. Generate 10 or more different design concepts of a system that addresses this challenge</h4>
        <p class="body_text">
            In the course of this task, we decided to do a brainstorm session between our group in order to get a more or less clear idea of the tasks that must be performed by the user. This allowed us to narrow down a flexible flow of the game. After this session, all were having a lot of ideas on a common base. Then we isolated ourselves to sketch 4 designs and/or design variations each, for a total of 12 designs. These  sketches are included below. For two of the three sets, a general flow was sketched, and then individual views were numbered so specific changes to them could be made in the other sketches. 
        </p>

        </div>

        <h4>Step 3. Reduce the number of design concepts</h4>
        <p class="body_text">
            Based on our strategy in part 2, all of our team members met in order to share designs and discuss them. Instead of looking at a given design in full, we focused our efforts to compare the designs on a view-by-view basis. Then, for each view we kept the best 2 or 3 designs, and in some cases a single one, because a team member contributed an idea that brought some significant advantages to the overall design.
        </p>

        <h4>Step 4. Choose the most promising design concept as a starting point</h4>
        <p class="body_text">
            At this point, since we kept only 2-3 design for each view, most of them had potential and provided various advantages to the game. Still, some designs were missing some small details. Hence, for some views, we decided to merge to separate designs to create a single view. Finally to create our starting point, we used the best design or combination of designs to come up with a brand new flow.
        </p>

    <h3>Usability Goals</h3>
    <div>
        <p class="body_text">
            For the game to be successful, we set 6 usability goals, separated between the initial setup required before the game can be played, and then the game itself.
        </p>

        <h4>Initial Setup Goals</h4>
            <p class="list_elem_title">1. The setup is easy to use</p>
            <p class="body_text">
                We want the setup to be painless, so it should employ existing conventions used by mobile application to allow the user to apply known concepts to our interface. The hesitation of users, the mistakes they make, and feedback they give will be used to determine whether we’re on the right track.
            </p>

            <p class="list_elem_title">2. The setup is not too long</p>
            <p class="body_text">
                This goes hand in hand with the previous goal. Before playing, some information is necessary for the game to progress properly: a group name, IDs for each player, and the selection of a subject and of a game mode. Since we want the game to get people off their phones, we don’t want the person doing the initial setup on the phone that will be passed around to be isolated for a significant period of time. The setup should take no more than 3 minutes.
            </p>

            <p class="list_elem_title">3. The setup does not repeat too often</p>
            <p class="body_text">
                This goes hand in hand with the previous goal. Before playing, some information is necessary for the game to progress properly: a group name, IDs for each player, and the selection of a subject and of a game mode. Since we want the game to get people off their phones, we don’t want the person doing the initial setup on the phone that will be passed around to be isolated for a significant period of time. The setup should take no more than 3 minutes.
            </p>

        <h4>Game Goals</h4>

            <p class="list_elem_title">4. All players participate in the game</p>
            <p class="body_text">
                We want the game to be playable with a single phone, but also to engage all members of the game. We have thought of several means to do this: the act of passing the phone around, a timer, text-to-speech for elements that only one person sees, and others. We will have to see whether these are effective at keeping people playing as a group, without members being left hanging for long periods of time.
            </p>

            <p class="list_elem_title">5. The length of the game is adequate</p>
            <p class="body_text">
                If the game is too short, the group might spend too much time in the setup part of the application, choosing subjects, and restarting. If the game is too long, then players may lose interest. This is subjective, but will most likely surface in user feedback.
            </p>

            <p class="list_elem_title">6. The game is a fun solution when people notice that they are all on their smartphone</p>
            <p class="body_text">
                The game relies on the users to access it from the application icon when they notice that their group is not socializing. To ensure that users actually use it, it should be fun, rather than requiring too much effort to get going. The positivity of feedback received from users, specifically relating to the idea itself rather than the kinks of the current design, will be a good benchmark of whether users would play the game on their own when they notice a good opportunity.
            </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Benchmark Tasks</h3>
    <div>
        <p class="body_text">The benchmark tasks that follow are intended to allow a tester to reflect on the 5 goals listed above, and see whether they were reached. The are left intentionally broad, to allow for variation when testing.</p>

        <p class="list_elem_title">1. Set up a game for the current group</p>
        <p class="body_text">Relevant to goals 1, 2. This task will allow us to see users move through the setup process, and see whether it is easy to use, and whether it is too long. If the users move through the setup successfully and painlessly, then the purpose of this screen is fulfilled.</p>

        <p class="list_elem_title">2. Play through two rounds of the game</p>
        <p class="body_text">Relevant to goals 4, 5, 6. This task is central to the game itself, and will give the testers feedback on how well the game solves the targeted problem. Subjective user feedback is critical for this task, since the things evaluated are subjective: whether the game is fun, too long, too short, whether a person feels like they are participating or forcing themselves to play. The number of rounds is set to two, but might need to be increased to get more insight into the proper duration for a set of rounds. We will also be able to see where there are hiccups, since it is expected that the game will not go smoothly at first.
        </p>

        <p class="list_elem_title">3. Start a new game with a different subject</p>
        <p class="body_text">Relevant to goals 1, 2, 3, 6. This task is helpful because we want users to play the game, rather than spend time repeating setup steps that were already accomplished. If a game with subject A was completed, a group should be able to start a new game with subject B, without having to redefine the group name, team names, member names, and other information.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Test Materials</h3>
    <div>
        <p class="body_text">
            The following were prepared to help the tester go through testing. The materials include a general test script to introduce the task at hand to users, pre- and post-test questionnaires, scripts for specific tests, and a sample data collection sheet.
        </p>

        <h4>Test Script</h4>
        <p class="body_text">
            Hello, my name is [Team Member Name]. As you may already know, my partners and I are currently developing an application to encourage face-to-face interactions in small groups of friends. This mobile application is in the form of a quiz game. Thank you for joining me today for the initial usability testing of our prototypes. We have developed three interfaces for our game and we would like to see how potential users handle the different designs. With your permission, I would like to record parts of your interaction with the prototype. This video will not be publicly released and will only be used to help us modify our design to better fit your needs. If you are still interested in participating in our usability tests, I would need to have your signature on a participant release form. This is only to show your voluntary consent to participate in our study and be recorded.
            <br>
            <br>
            We are not evaluating your performance or your technological capabilities; we are testing our design choices. If you are unsure about something or think you are about to make a mistake, please do not worry about the outcome, as we want to observe where the user can be misled or confused. Finally, any comments you may have are appreciated. If you are comfortable doing so, please think aloud while navigating the prototype, so we can better understand what you are doing. Please feel free to ask questions during the tests, but I may not always be able to answer them as we want to see what choices you naturally make while interacting with our design.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before we begin, I would like you to all fill out this pre-test questionnaire, which will help us better understand your mobile phone usage and habits.

        <h4>Specific Tests</h4>
        <p class="body_text">Run each of the following 3 tests on the testees. Tests 1 and 3 require the testees to be isolated from the rest of the group.</p>

        <p class="list_elem_title">Test 1. Briefing and Script</p>
        <p class="body_text">We would like you to get familiar with the application first.
        <br>
        [Testee X], you need to set up a Free-For-All game. The other testee and yourself will be the only players (if only one testee is present, add imaginary Friends X). Choose a subject of your choice for the questions you’ll be asked.
        <br>
        Once [Testee X] is done the first task [...]
        <br>
        [Testee Y], you need to set up a 2 vs 2 Team game. The other testee and yourself will be on one team (if only one testee is present, add imaginary Friends X), and the other team will consist of imaginary players: Player 1 and Player 2. Choose a subject of your choice for the questions you’ll be asked.
        </p>

        <p class="list_elem_title">Test 2. Briefing and Script</p>
        <p class="body_text">The next step is to actually play the game. [Testee X], you’ll be the one starting with the smartphone. The game will tell you what you need to do to progress. 
        <br>
        ( [Testee X] should have asked [Testee Y] a question and passed the phone to them after being prompted to by the game. Telling them to do so directly defeats the purpose of the design. )
        <br>
        [Testee Y], you have to remember the question that was just asked. Now that you have the phone, you can answer the question. 
        <br>
        ( See if [Testee Y] understands the tools at their disposal (ask Google, ask team member). After answering, both [Testee X] and [Testee Y] should know the answer that was chosen by [Testee Y], and the game will tell [Testee Y] to return the phone to [Testee X]. )
        <br>
        That was a practice round. Now we would like you to play through another round and we’ll see how it goes.

        </p>

        <p class="list_elem_title">Test 3. Briefing and Script</p>
        <p class="body_text">Now that you are more familiar with the actual gameplay, it is time to access different functionalities. [Testee X], you need to modify the selected subject from the last game and restart the game.

    <h3>Summary of Test Results</h3>
    <div>
        <p class="body_text">The selected test subjects were all students and from the same age group, which limited the coverage of the intended user population. The first round of testing was performed on the McGill campus on a single individual and the second round was on two roommates in their apartment.
        <br>
        The tests brought several interesting insights, but suffered from the low quality of the paper prototype, which caused comprehension issues. This may have affected the user’s understanding of the UI and induce some false positives. Some of the confusion probably came from having to decrypt the handwriting, for example. Furthermore, the interface greatly depends on interactive behaviour, such as drop downs or input boxes being added on after a user’s action, which could not easily be simulated on paper. Most of the feedback we received was related to confusing labels or navigation issues, not on the organization or structure of each screen’s UI.
        <br><br>
        On most occasions, users were able to infer what they did not understand, e.g. during the setup a subject did not understand what a Group Name represented but still selected Create a new Group instead of Select Existing Group. This is likely due to the small amount of information in each screen during the setup of the game. One of the key points pointed out by the testees, was the lack of the capability to navigate through the setup. Exiting the gameplay at any point was also a requested feature. As it was mentioned earlier, the question and answer screens were found to be a bit cluttered, but the testees quickly understood what was expected of them, i.e. the mobile device needs to go to Player X and the question is intended for Player Y. One of the test subjects mentioned how it might be hard to remember the question if it is too long, as the question disappears once the Answer screen is loaded. This is a part of the game for now, but future tests simulating actual questions will be accomplished to determine if gameplay is negatively affected because of this feature.
        <br><br>
        There were very few missteps during the second round of testing, and the overall speed at which the tasks were executed was satisfactory. Setting up a one vs one game took less than 30 seconds, and the actual gameplay from one player to the other flowed rather smoothly. The initial confusion disappeared as the first round advanced, as the repetitive nature of the game helps solidify the understanding of the game rules.
        <br><br>
        To conclude, this first round of usability testing introduced several potential variations to the prototype that were not initially considered. The navigation between steps in the setup was very important to the observed subjects, and the amount of text per screen needed to be minimal to not confuse first time users. Future tests will hopefully better simulate actual gameplay and give insight towards users’ appreciation of the game.
