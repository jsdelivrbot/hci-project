        You're sitting with a group of friends, and yet everyone is on their phone. No social interaction whatsoever. Has this ever happened to you? Pass the Phone is a mobile game whose goal may seem contradictory at first: to get people off their phone! The game only needs one person's phone, which gets passed around as people ask questions and answer them as a group.

    <p class="body_text">
        On this site, you will find the step-by-step procedure that was followed to reach a presentable beta of the project, inspired by HCI development guidelines. The steps were as follows:
        <ol>
            <li><a href="project_proposal.html">Project Proposal</a>: The initial idea behind the project.</li>
            <li><a href="lo_fi_prototype.html">Low-Fidelity Prototype</a>: A new direction for the project, with the same goal but different means, and the first rudimentary paper prototype.</li>
            <li><a href="hi_fi_prototype.html">High-Fidelity Prototype</a>: The first software prototype of the game.</li>
            <li><a href="feedback.html">Formative Feedback</a>: The results of an exercise in which we evaluated the hi-fi prototype of another team.</li>
            <li><a href="alpha.html">Alpha Prototype</a>: The next version of the game's software prototype, incorporating feedback from a testing team.</li>
            <li><a href="beta.html">Beta Prototype</a>: The final version of the game in the scope of the class, also affected by further testing. </li>
