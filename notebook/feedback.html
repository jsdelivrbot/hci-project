    <h3>Testing</h3>

        <p class="body_text">
            We were tasked with testing the <a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~jer/courses/hci/project/2017/www.ece.mcgill.ca/~jshin22/HCIWebPage/
" target="_blank">Bill Splitting Web Service</a>.
            <br>
            User testing was completed on three test subjects. The desired user population consists of students looking to manage their bills and split expenses, as can be observed in the documentation accompanying the high-fidelity prototype. The chosen test subjects, all fourth year McGill students, clearly fall into this classification. All three team members were present at all times during the usability tests, and each acted as either paper observer, video observer or evaluator for one of the tests. These were conducted in Trottier 4160, a computer laboratory at McGill University. This familiar environment was ideal for the various tests, and to put the subjects at ease. The tests lasted approximately 10-15 minutes for each subject. The user introduction and consent form was initially read to the subject, followed by the pre-test document. Each test task was then administered sequentially. Finally, the post-test questionnaire was held and the test subjects’ comments were dutifully noted. The testing documents for each subject can be found below.

    <h3>Results and Analysis</h3>
    <div>
        <p class="body_text">
            Here are the results to the tests that were conducted. For each test, we present the results obtained, along with similarities and differences between users, and other comments. In the next section, usability issues that were identified are listed, justified, and linked to usability heuristics.
        </p>

        <h4>Test 1: Verify if your roommate paid last month's rent</h4>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>“You want to find out whether your roommate Steve Simmons has paid last month’s rent. Can you find this information?”</i>
        </p>
        <div class="figure">

            <p class="tip">Figure 1. Results of the quantitative measurement of time for test 1</p>
        </div>
        <p class="body_text">
            The quantitative data, measuring the time taken to find if Steve Simmons had paid this month’s rent, suggests wildly different test results across all three users. The results are shown above. It is safe to say that at least one user had a significant problem finding the information. The issue seemed to be that it wasn’t clear to the user that they could click on a bill name to access further information on the bill. The dates were a point of confusion raised by Subject 3, since they were asked to find whether Steve had paid last month’s rent, but the page displayed the current date. Once the users had found the page containing detailed information on the rent, the color coding and icons made it easy to identify whether Steve had paid or not. Therefore, the major hurdle was getting to the information; parsing it afterwards was straightforward.

        <h4>Test 2: Create a bill to pay for your gym membership</h4>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>“You want to organize your <s>apartment’s rent</s> gym payments. Please set up a bill for this with the following information.” Note: erroneous name in test document description.</i>
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            <b>Results</b>
            <br>
            Subject 1: Unsuccessful, did not add themselves to the bill.
            <br>
            Subject 2: Success, all fields were correctly completed.
            <br>
            Subject 3: Success, all fields were correctly completed.
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            The test subjects all reacted quite similarly when completing this task. The issues that affected the flow of their operations were non-critical in most cases, as they were able to infer the correct procedure and continue. The first issue resulted from the very general date input, and the seemingly useless submit button next to it. The first subject wrote the date in plain text in french, while the two other subjects used the big-endian format (YYYY/MM/DD). This step slowed down each subject, as they had to pick the format to use. The first and third subject asked: “What does this submit button even do?”. The second common issue was whether or not the person creating the bill needs to add themselves as a payer of the bill. The first subject only added Tim as the payer, while the following two subjects asked whether or not they needed to add themselves, and correctly guessed that they had to. Finally, the third issue was related to the set checkbox for the repeat bill option. The subjects all selected the checkbox, but were unsure about its meaning. The first subject checked, unchecked and checked it before continuing. The third subject asked: “What’s the set checkbox?”.

        <h4>Test 3: Create a bill for an upcoming party</h4>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>“You want to organize a party for you and some friends next week. How would you go about this?”</i>
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            <b>Results</b>
            <br>
            Subject 1: Success, created a bill for the whole party.
            <br>
            Subject 2: Unsuccessful, created a bill for groceries, and stopped there.
            <br>
            Subject 3: Unsuccessful, revised their initial approach and ended up creating a bill with entry fees for the party.
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            The description was intentionally left vague to see how the user wraps their mind around the task at hand. Therefore, a quantitative measurement of the number of errors is not appropriate for this test. We observed two different approaches to solving this problem. Subject 1 created a bill for the whole party, and added people that would need to pay their share. It was unclear what the amount due represented in this case.  Subject 2 wanted to split the bills for the party according to the various expenses related to the party. They started by creating a grocery bill. However, they quickly noted that the amount due for an upcoming party wasn’t known in advance, which caused problems when splitting costs. Also, including themselves in the list felt awkward due to having to enter their own information, despite being both the creator and payee. Similar to the past subject, Subject 3 also wanted to separate the bill initially. They were struggling with trying to fit the expenses of the party into a single bill, and ending up changing their initial idea in favor of asking an entry fee to each person.
            <br><i>“I guess I can include a picture of the bill later?”</i> - Subject 2
            <br><i>“It would be fun if I could subdivide the [expenses]”</i> - Subject 3

        <p class="body_text">
            <i>“Please change the password for the user account.”</i>
        </p>
       <p class="body_text">
            <b>Results</b>
            <br>
            Subject 1: Success, no navigation errors and password successfully changed.
            <br>
            Subject 2: Success, no navigation errors and password successfully changed.
            <br>
            Subject 3: Unsuccessful, 1 navigation error, selected the top right username icon before selecting the Settings tab.
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            This test was successfully completed for the most part. The only issue was an initial erroneous navigation by one of the test subjects. Furthermore, it was found that the styling of the webpage breaks down on the Safari web browser. The test subjects had several complaints about the security implications of this step. First of all, the first subject was surprised to see that the new password was displayed as plain text. The third subject was unsatisfied by the lack of security measures in place to limit identity fraud, i.e. no needed confirmation that the account is owned by the user that is requesting a new password.

        <h4>Test 5: Complete a scenario</h4>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>“You have been using the system for several months now. You open the application to take care of some routine business. You remember that you’re the last person needed to pay your rent. You’d like to get this done quickly. Worried that you’re falling behind on payments, you check when your next car payment is due. All this stress makes you think of the water park, but can you check whether Peter paid yet? Finally, your bill list is looking a little cluttered so you decide to delete oldest bill.”</i>

        </div>
        <p class="body_text">
            All of the subjects required the tasks to be repeated. The scenario had several details that weren’t important and caused a large necessary cognitive load, which caused the subjects to ask for clarifications. The login stage was omitted in the tests as the login page was trivial i.e. even empty fields resulted in a successful login. The test results are separated into the individual tasks.

        <h5>1. Pay apartment rent from the dashboard</h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            The test subjects all successfully paid the car bill. Bill titles were read one-by-one until the rent bill was found. The second and third subjects selected the direct deposit or cash option, but these haven’t been implemented yet.

        <h5>2. Find when your next car bill is due</h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            Subjects all quickly located the car bill and selected the correct due date. The third user was the only one to use the search bar to find the car bill.

        <h5>3. Check the waterpark bill to see whether Peter paid</h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            In test 1, two users initially struggled to find the bill details page. Now that they were familiar with the way to access the page, they all inferred after a few seconds that this could be found by clicking on the bill’s title. All three users correctly determined that Peter had not yet paid the bill.
        </p>

        <h5>4. Delete the oldest bill</h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            Two of the subjects assumed that the bills were already ordered by date and incorrectly deleted the bill found at the bottom of the page. The other subject selected the sort by date and deleted the correct bill. They remarked after selecting the sort button a few times: “Hard to see which one is oldest”, referencing the lack of an indicator for the sorting order (increasing or decreasing).

    <h3>Usability Issues</h3>
    <div>
        <p class="body_text">
            The following usability issues were identified in the application. The appropriate heuristics are related to them, and they are assigned a priority: high or medium. Low priority issues are either included in the listed issue (e.g. typos) or will necessarily be fixed by moving to a more complete implementation. 
        </p>

        <h5>1. Lack of an “undo” or “quit” button for some sections of the application <b>[HIGH]</b></h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Referenced heuristic: User Control and Freedom</i>
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            Some actions cannot easily be undone by users in the event that they make a mistake. For one, the popup that appears when clicking the “pay” button on a bill cannot be closed. If a user changes their mind after seeing the price, they cannot go back to the dashboard easily; they are effectively forced to pay. There is also no way to cancel the creation of a bill, or postpone it, other than to return to the dashboard by clicking on it in the header. Similarly, when a user clicks on the bill’s name to access details, there is no clear back button to return to the dashboard.  Additionally, even if the user manual mentions that the deletion of an account is permanent, there is no roadblock in the application itself to ensure the user is confident in their choice. Since the deletion of an account is major, an option for the user to cancel that decision at the last minute would respect this heuristic. Also, once a bill is deleted, it is gone forever. This could be an issue for some users. For example, when asked to delete the oldest bill in the list, two users forgot to sort beforehand and simply deleted the last one. There is no way to restore the bill in this case. There is no way to remove a picture once it has been attached to a bill. 
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
            <img src="assets/fb/use_fig1.png">
            <p class="tip">Users are effectively forced to pay after clicking on the “quick pay” button</p>
        </div>

        <br>
        <h5>2. Terms or concepts involved in the application can sometimes lead to confusion <b>[HIGH]</b></h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Referenced heuristics: Match between system and the real world, Consistency and standards</i>
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            The application’s wording is generally polished, but it would benefit from some proof-reading (typos include "loging", "appartment", and "ammount", among others). However, some terms were hurdles for users. The first area of confusion was the ability to “quick pay” a bill using cash. The application’s intention is for users to mark that they have now paid the bill, but users interpreted this as the application allowing them to pay cash over the Internet. This brought doubt to the intention of the two other options, “Pay using credit card” and “Pay using direct deposit”, since those options don’t allow a user to pay directly either. The button’s title, “pay”, and the subtitle “pay using”, were mislabeled if the application does not allow a user to pay using the system. Changing “pay” to “paid”, for instance “Apartment rent, paid using cash”, could be a solution. If the application does allow users to pay directly in the future, then the inclusion of “cash” in the same list as the other online methods will also lead to confusion.
            The option to “set” a bill to repeat caused confusion for all three users, even though the eventually understood its meaning. This is because they had to choose the frequency at which they wanted the bill to repeat in the first place; the “set” checkbox was seen as a further step, whose function was unclear. 
        </p>
        <div class="figure">

        </div>
        <p class="body_text">
            On the same page, the fields for the amount convey conflicting information: the first one correctly tells the user the amount due, but for the following rows, the field displays “mobile”.

            <p class="tip">The textboxes for “amount due” change placeholders when more rows are added</p>
        </div>

        <br>
        <h5>3. Lack of feedback messages and indicators <b>[MEDIUM]</b></h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Referenced heuristics: Match between system and the real world, Consistency and standards</i>
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            Users do not always know how to enter data or whether or not their selection is complete and correct. The bill creation tab is a long process with almost no feedback along the way. Firstly, there are too many different date formats to require a user to input a date in a textfield. Furthermore, the submit button beside the date does not provide any feedback. Secondly, the person creating the bill does not inherently know that they need to add themselves as a payer of the bill (for a bill split evenly this step seems redundant). Finally, the set checkbox for the repeat bill option is confusing, as a selected option does not result in the option being set. A second user action is needed to trigger the setting. This does not match a usual flow of operations, as the user has to accomplish additional steps. Furthermore, profile settings are commonly found on the user’s profile page, which is accessed by clicking on the profile icon. The icon at the top left references a user profile, but clicking it brings a user back to the top of the page, which can be confusing as it does not follow the standard established by other profile-based websites. This functionality would benefit from being assigned to a separate button, which would create a clearer mapping. Additionally, the sorting buttons stay the same after a user interacts with them. There is no indication of which sorting method is being applied, or whether the sort is in increasing or decreasing order.  
        </p>

        <br>
        <h5>4. Error handling isn’t implemented across the prototype <b>[HIGH]</b></h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Referenced heuristics: Error prevention, Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</i>
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            Most of the problems observed with regards to the lack of feedback and indicators could be avoided by implementing some sort of error checking. The bill creation page, for example, requires several fields to be completed and there is currently no error handling: a bill is still submitted if fields are left empty or have illogical inputs (e.g. a word as the payment amount). Input validation for each step would greatly benefit users. This would ease the first exposure to the webpage or when completing an unfamiliar task, as each action is positively reinforced. The user currently has no way to know if an input is correct or not, and if it will prevent the bill from being created. Every field should have error prevention or at least error handling, so the application moves users along a correct path, and tells them clearly when the information entered in a field is incorrect. Furthermore, there is no confirmation prompt for important transactions. Paying a bill, deleting a bill, changing a password or deleting an account, four sensitive actions, is automatically accepted if it is selected. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <h5>5. Lack of differentiation between items that can be interacted with, and items that can’t <b>[MEDIUM]</b></h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Referenced heuristics: User control and freedom, Consistency and standards, Aesthetic and minimalist design, Recognition rather than recall</i>
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            One user had particular trouble finding how to access detailed information for a bill. They could not find that they were meant to click on the bill’s title. The title is underlined when hovered, which is appropriate; however, at a glance, there is little indication that the title is clickable in the first place, as it is barely differentiated from the text below it. It looks like a title rather than a link.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
            <img src="assets/fb/use_fig4.png">
            <p class="tip">To access detailed information for a bill, users are meant to click the title “Apartment Rent”</p>
        </div>
        <p class="body_text">
            This problem arose in other areas, such as the buttons to add people to a bill. Their appearance on Firefox is illustrated below. These buttons are not any different from the text label above them, and the “Delete Row” button does not signal that it cannot be used when there is only one row. 
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
            <img src="assets/fb/use_fig5.png">
            <p class="tip">The buttons to add row and delete row look like labels, and don’t show their status</p>
        </div>
        <p class="body_text">
            Also, all rows across the application highlight when they are hovered, even though the rows themselves cannot be clicked or interacted with. When rows are used to simply display information in table form, such as on the bill details page, this is misleading. Finally, the user’s name is in the top left, and the cursor shows that it is a link when hovered. However, clicking on it often results in no change. This is because its behavior at the moment is to link users back to the top of the page, which is not obvious. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <h5>6. Lack of differentiation between bills for which the user is a recipient, or a contributor <b>[MEDIUM]</b></h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Referenced heuristics: Match between system and real world, Error prevention, Consistency and standards</i>
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            There is further confusion regarding bills for which the users is awaiting money from someone else. As can be seen below, the dashboard currently prompts the user to pay a bill for which they are the recipient. This is obviously a misuse of the pay button. When checking the details of the bill, the user sees that they have paid their share — to themselves — and that they are waiting for Peter to pay. 
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="body_text">
            This results in murky interaction: should the user include themselves in bills where they were part of the activity, but already paid? Should they include themselves at all when requesting payment from others? Are they Jane Doe, and if so, why are they being referred to both in the second and third person on the same bill? The indicator that they are a recipient is small and easy to miss: it is given the same visual importance as a category, despite being critical to the bill.

    <h3>Test Plan Critique</h3>
    <div>
        <p class="body_text">
            Before continuing, we wish to tell the development team that their test documents made the testing process quite easy and streamlined for us, the testing team. The following aims to be constructive criticism with the goal of improving the tests in the future, contributing to the improvement of the application, and giving insight into the testing process that we experienced.
        </p>

        <h4>Usability goals</h4>
        <p class="body_text">
            A recurring problem across tests was the confusing nature of some terminology. The development team have properly identified that this is an area that is crucial for their application, but only in their test documents. A usability goal related to this area could be added, and be linked to a quantitative measurement such as the number of questions a user asks aloud when they encounter something unclear, or the number of mistakes due to unclear wording.
        </p>

        <h4>Prototype</h4>
        <p class="body_text">
            The prototype is fairly complete, but some oversights in the implementation caused problems during testing. These were integrated into the usability issues section above and in the data collection sheets, and include mislabeled fields and the lack of error checking.
        </p>

        <h4>Test Procedure</h4>
        <p class="body_text">
            The test documents were all supplied and outlined a generally successful procedure. The test cases allowed us to see which usability goals were respected and which weren’t. However, some quantitative measurements were hard to apply to the test case at hand. For example, when creating an entirely new bill for a party, which is a vague test designed to see whether users could use the application instinctively, it was hard to quantify the number of mistakes made due to the lack of a “correct” solution. The test was still successful in pointing out that some major functionality was lacking from the application: the ability to group bills, or separate a bill into sub-bills. Often, the number of errors did not reflect the problems that users were able to identify with the application, as they were still able to adapt to the interface they were given. For example, users all commented on the date form, since the format of the date required by the application was not explicit. The formats they entered were all different, but could not be considered outright wrong, as the issue was with the application. Another example is the “set” checkbox next to the option to have a bill repeat, which all users checked despite noting that it was awkward.
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            Some errors that were identified as important to avoid were redundant. This was especially apparent for the first test, where a user is asked to see whether Steve Simmons had paid their share of the apartment rent. The issue for users was to reach the information in the first place, but the test seemed to target whether users were able to parse the displayed table once they reached the information. However, to the credit of the prototype, the table is quite clear, and even color-coded; few users would have mistakenly said that Steve had paid his share, but only once they managed to reach the table in the first place.
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            In addition to several typos across the test documents, some wording was unclear. This especially caused issues when they were instructions or questions asked to users. For example, in the post-test questionnaire, the user is asked whether “The information of the dashboard demonstrated enough information to understand the standing of the bill.” This could be rephrased as “The status of a bill was clearly visible directly on the dashboard”. 
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            The second test was to create a bill for a gym membership, split among two people. The test description information mentioned that the monthly amount due was $100, but the comment to be entered read that the money was split evenly between Jane Doe (the user) and Tim. This caused confusion with regards to the meaning of amount due, and who was responsible for the payment. Mentioning that the total bill was $100, to be split evenly among two people, would have solved this issue. This could also have raised an observation from users that splitting money among several people evenly is not always easy in number form (for example, splitting $287.65 three-way), and they could have suggested the addition of a percentage-split feature.
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            The last test consisted in a scenario, telling users a series of tasks to execute once they were familiar with the system. By the third user, we decided to segment the test into several tasks and read them to the user one at a time, instead of as a block, because users had difficulty remembering all the tasks.
        </p>

        <h4>Reporting</h4>
        <p class=body_text>
            The data collection sheet was well designed, and allowed the tester to jot down mistakes, improvements, and comments as things went along. It could have been improved by supplying more guidelines to the note-taker. These could be similar to those given to the person administering the tests, with more precise guidelines. For example, the types of errors to look out for could have been narrowed down: “look out for errors such as the way the user splits the amounts due among people, how they enter the date, and whether they set the bill to repeat” or “see whether the user deletes the oldest bill or an incorrect bill”.
        </p>

        <h4>Usability Evaluation</h4>
        <p class="body_text">
            The five usability heuristics selected by the development team were not justified adequately. Even if we could see why they were selected, more justification would have made the document more useful, and given more insight into why the usability evaluation was useful to the development team. For example, for “Match between system and the real world” further justification such as “We want the users to understand the terminology across the interface, in order to avoid confusion. For instance, users should be able to understand when they are a recipient or a contributor to a bill. They should also be able to split a bill among multiple just like they would in real life. They should understand the implications of telling the application that a bill was paid e.g. using cash, instead of trying to pay through the application“ would have been useful.
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            The document also only offers a Likert scale to evaluate the heuristics. We feel that the development team would get more insight from the process if they instructed the testing team to include their thoughts on how well the heuristics are met, and their reasoning. For this reason, we chose to integrate the heuristics with the usability issues listed above, and added heuristics that weren’t considered, such as “Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors” and “Error prevention”.

    <h3>Design Critique</h3>
    <div>
        <p class="body_text">
            The following suggestions aim to address the usability issues listed above and the problems that arose during the tests, either by fixing them or circumventing them.
        </p>

        <h4>Improvements to the Dashboard page</h4>
        <h5>1. Make the way to access the details of a bill more obvious to the user</h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Addresses issue 5</i>
            <br>
            This can be accomplished by adding a “details” button on each card, which would route the user directly to the bill’s detailed view. By doing so, the users knows directly where to click to obtain more details by reading the label. Also, this is an advantage for a first time user looking for this functionality. Alternatively, links could be more differentiated from generic text or headers to convey that they can be interacted with.
        </p>

        <h5>2. Allow the user to revert actions, specifically regarding bill deletion</h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Addresses issues 1, 4</i>
            <br>
            Many services now adopt a “trash can” model to item deletion. If a user decides to delete a bill, the bill could be stored in a trash can in the event that the action was a mistake. This would allow a user to restore an erroneously deleted bill. The bills in the trash can could be deleted permanently by a user, restored, or could expire after a set period.
        </p>

        <h5>3. Use colour and shapes to define selected sort order on the dashboard</h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Addresses issue 3, 5</i>
            <br>
            Sorting buttons should have more details and be more obvious. For example, when a sorting method is selected, it could be coloured to show what the state is. Also, arrows next to the button to convey sorting direction could be interesting for the user to choose directly the sort order he’s looking for. The current implementation of sorting also has evident issues when it comes to sorting by date properly, which is something that needs to be addressed.
        </p>

        <h5>4. Improve the distinction between bills for which users are recipients vs. contributors</h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Addresses issue 6</i>
            <br>
             Enforcing a visual distinction between bills where money is requested from the user (outgoing) and bills that will gain the user money (incoming) would be beneficial. The current implementation causes confusion, as users are requested to pay their own bills, sometimes in the third person. This could be done by adding icons to bills (such as incoming, outgoing arrows), color coding the bills even further, or splitting the dashboard in two parts (e.g. Bills to Pay, Bills to Collect). The latter option would also add the benefit of assigning visually different spaces to the two opposed categories.
        </p>

        <h5>5. Improve search functionality to have a broader search.</h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>New heuristic: Flexibility and efficiency of use</i>
            <br>
            The search function could also index the bill details. This would be helpful for test 1, where a user could directly search for a person (e.g. Steve Simmons) and see which bills they are included in. To push this functionality further and be more suitable for users with a lot of bills, an advanced search could be implemented to search specifically for payers, payees, category, etc.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h4>Improvements to the Create New Bill page</h4>
        <h5>1. Suggest required data format to the user</h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Addresses issue 3, 4</i>
            <br>
            This suggestion is primarily applicable to the due date text field. In order to improve efficiency to input the data and force the format, a date picker can be used. This also prevents possible errors to be thrown to the user for not inputting the date properly.
        </p>

        <h5>2. Improve input efficiency by placing items that are related close to each other.</h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Addresses issue 2 + Flexibility and efficiency of use</i>
            <br>
            This is relevant in the case of <i>due date</i> and <i>repeat bill</i>. Generally, when setting up a due date for an invoice, the user knows if it’s recurrent or not. Hence, by putting those nearby that allows the user to set those two attributes one after the other while his thoughts are still on the topic of payments dates.
        </p>

        <h5>3. Add a method to split a bill among multiple people using percentages</h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Addresses issue 2</i>
            <br>
            To achieve this, it could be interesting to have a single box to enter the full amount of the invoice, and then add a <i>split</i> button to split the amount among all users entered according to a set percentage. This would also make it easier to split total amounts that are not neat numbers.
        </p>

        <h5>4. Allow users to separate a bill into sub-bills</h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Addresses issue 2</i>
            <br>
            Test 3 asked users to create a new bill for an upcoming party. Two users mentioned the fact that a party required multiple expenses, and found using the current single-bill approach cumbersome, as it did not allow them to approach the task as they would in real life. A solution to this would be to allow users to add bills for all the expenses, and then split the total among people. For example, in a bill named "party", sub-bills like "groceries", "drinks", "speakers", and "room" could be created, with a price next to them. The application could then display the total to be split among people. Users would then use the existing row approach to complete the bill.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h4>Improvements to the Settings page</h4>
        <h5>1. Clicking on the username at the top left of the screen could link an account overview, or at least to the settings page</h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Addresses issues 2, 3, 5</i>
            <br>
            Implementing this functionality would follow what is commonly done in website requiring logins, and create a clear association between the person's name and the page to which it leads.
        </p>

        <h5>2. Add a confirmation field asking for a user's old password before changing the password to a new one</h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Addresses issues 1, 3</i>
            <br>
            This extra step would allow users to consciously confirm that they want to change their password, and also make sure that the user is the one attempting the operation.
        </p>

        <h5>3. Add confirmation of some sort before deleting the account, to signify that the action is permanent</h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Addresses issues 1, 3</i>
            <br>
            The user manual mentions that account deletion is permanent. The current implementation makes it too easy for the user to delete their account. If they are unsure, or if the operation is an error, there is no way to go back. Several options can be explored for this feature. For example, the developers could implement a confirmation dialog, or could require the user to enter their password before deletion.
        </p>

        <h5>4. Improve confidentiality when the user is entering sensitive information such as password</h5>
        <p class="body_text">
            <i>Addresses issues 1, 3</i>
            <br>
            The current field for entering a password displays the entered information for all to see. Making the fields actual HTML password fields, so that the information entered in them is hidden by default, would solve this. It could also make people feel more at ease, and help the user recognize that the information being entered is a password. Users should be familiar with password fields around the Web, so implementing this behavior here plays on an existing association: a password is sensitive information, and should be kept private.
