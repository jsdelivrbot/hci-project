    <h2>Project Proposal</h2>

    <!-- Observe several users carrying out the activity you've chosen to focus on for your project. Describe your observations of these users as they carried out the specific activity. -->

    <h3>Observations</h3>
    <div class="body_text">
        <h4>Family eating dinner</h4>
        <p>Three people sit at the dinner table to eat at the end of the day. While eating, everyone is using their
            smartphone — they are looking downwards toward their smartphone screen. One person has earphones on while
            watching a YouTube video. Another is looking at the day's e-mails and planifying their day for tomorrow. The
            third is reading articles. When asked questions, short and somewhat dismissive answers are given. Sometimes
            a person interrupts what they are doing to read and answer to a new message (Facebook, Snapchat, SMS). There
            is no conversation going on at the table, only occasional short questions and answers.
        </p>

        <h4>Significant others in the living room</h4>
        <p>Two people are in the living room. Netflix is running, the dog is sleeping and humans are silent. One is
            watching Netflix while the other is reading some articles. Both subjects have their phone nearby ready for
            any alert. The subject reading article (Female) is often interrupted by the multiple group chats that are
            going on on multiple platforms (Messenger, SMS, Snapchat), those group chats are mostly for social purpose
            (not work or school related). The other one (Male) is mostly getting emails related to work and answers them
            right away.
            Once the individual activities are completed and they get into a conversation together, the same scenario
            arises: as soon as they get an alert, they reply. The main difference is that after the reply, they don't
            stick to their smartphone to pursue other activities, they join back in the conversation.</p>

        <h4>Roommates hanging out</h4>
        <p>
            Three roommates are sitting in the communal area of their apartment. They chose to sit here for company, but
            instantly pull out their cell phones. The individuals look away from their phone at times, but usually
            glance back fairly quickly. An individual putting down his phone does not trigger the others to do so. On
            the other hand, when one of them speaks up, they all stop using their phones and listen. Oral conversations
            seem to have precedence on digital ones.</p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <div class="body_text">
        <p>As we observed, people tend to spend a great amount of time using their smartphones for socialization.
            Activities are varied: texting friends through SMS or iMessage, checking a Facebook feed, organizing a
            work-related e-mail inbox, or sending ephemeral messages through Snapchat. Even when in groups, with friends
            or family, while eating or just hanging out, people tend to confine themselves to their smartphones. This
            can be seen in the picture below, taken during the last observation session.
        </p>

        <img class="figure" src="assets/pp/observation_roommates.jpg">

        <p> Our observations suggest that this is due to the hard-to-resist pull of sheer information and total
            entertainment. This is in line with a recent study from the McCombs School of Business at The University of
            Texas at Austin, which reveals that the presence of person's smartphone nearby is enough to distract them
            and "reduce available cognitive capacity" [1].
        </p>


        <p>The convenience of social interaction through a smartphone is also hard to match. Sending a message is quick
            and easy, compared to the effort required by a telephone call or a meeting in person. The entertainment
            value of the message can also be augmented by including a funny picture, a video, or a series of emojis --
            things that aren't available to rely on in conventional face-to-face interaction. A side-effect of the
            greatly facilitated communication brought by technology is that messages tend to be uniform and direct.
            Laughter is reduced to a few characters and jokes have trendy and easily-replicable formats. Many
            conversations are also results-focused -- for example, agreeing on quick meet-ups, or dry Slack chats.
        </p>

        <p>With this in mind, our goal is to add some variety to social interaction and encourage
            face-to-face conversation. Effectively, we want to create a smartphone application that deters users from
            excessive useof their smartphone for socialization. However, applications to prevent direct smartphone use
            already exist.Rather, we want to take a fun-centered approach. To do this, the application would suggest an
            uncommon word, a phrase, a question, a discussion topic, or other such facilitators to use in real-life
            conversation.

    <h3>Personas</h3>
    <div class="body_text">
        <p>Our observations relate specifically to smartphone users in social environments, since we would like to
            reduce smartphone use in these situations. We grouped these individuals into two personas: those receptive
            to face-to-face social interaction, and those unreceptive to it. We noted that the environment in which a
            person is will influence their receptivity: a person in a group of friends and acquaintances will be more
            receptive to their attempts at socializing, whereas a person surrounded by strangers will be more likely to
            isolate themselves.
        </p>

        <h4>The Receptive Individual</h4>
        <p>Even if this person is using their smartphone in a social environment, they will be open to further
            face-to-face interaction. They may be reading and replying to messages, or interacting with other
            information that requires little attention. They will be ready to quit using their smartphone if there is a
            conversation going on, but may revert to it if there is a lull. This person’s smartphone is used to satisfy
            boredom. They may or may not try to initiate conversations (depending on the degree to which they are hooked
            to their phone), but will be eager to participate in one. These users would be ready to accept a word-based
            challenge or a discussion topic.
        </p>

        <h4>The Unreceptive Individual</h4>
        <p>This person is absorbed by what they are doing on their phone. The content they are interacting with requires
            more attention: a video, a mobile game, or a quick social feed. They may also be using earphones for videos
            or music, further isolating them from their surroundings. When asked questions, they will appear bothered,
            due to being dragged away from the smartphone that requires their attention. If alone, they may benefit from
            icebreaker challenges. If in a group of friends, they could be dragged into a lively conversation that
            people who are more receptive are engaged in.
        </p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>To reach these personas, we first individually gathered actions from the observation sessions detailed above.
            When then joined our three lists into a single table:
        </p>

        <img class="table" src="assets/pp/table_personas_all.png">

        <p>Afterwards, we removed duplicates and grouped the remaining action in a second table:</p>

        <img class="table" src="assets/pp/table_personas_narrowed.png">

        <p> We then set out to group these tasks according to the users that might perform them. By this point, we had
            to reconsider the focus of our observation groups. Rather than simply observing people engaging in social
            interaction, we had narrowed our user base down to people using smartphones in groups. Due to this
            perspective, several of our actions involving smartphones were common to both responsive and unresponsive
            users, even though they were actions that a smartphone user may do in a group and that we initially
            considered significant. We also noted the difference between people in a group of acquaintances or
            strangers, but opted against including them as personas due to the significant overlap with the receptive
            and unreceptive classification. Finally, after narrowing down the actions further to those deemed truly
            distinguishing and assigning them to our personas, we reached the results in the table below:
        </p>

    <h3>Use Case Scenario</h3>
    <div class="body_text">
        <p>To illustrate the use of our application, let's take the case of the roommates above. They all know each
            other well, but may find that using their smartphone is easier than sparking a conversation. In this case,
            one person could open the application and quickly find a suggested question, or a word, or a similar
            challenge that could facilitate social interaction. The person could also have used the application earlier
            in the day, and kept the suggestion in the back of their mind. Say the application suggests a funny word.
            The user would try to think of a way to steer conversation towards using this word. Roommates that are
            receptive would react well to this subject introduction and let their phones rest; others that are less so
            may be pulled in if the conversation gets lively. Afterwards, if the suggestion was used, the user would
            revisit the application to mark as a success the introduction of the app suggestion. This would be rewarded
            in some way: a point system could be implemented, or a picture shown (social media share buttons would go
            against the purpose of the application, so we opt not to use them).
        </p>

        <p>For this scenario to be a success, the application would have to be simple, efficient, and most of all
            engaging. The user's interaction with the application would have to be very low-friction, in the sense that
            the aim is to provide a small snippet of information and simple interactions in a straightforward, not
            cumbersome, manner. Most of all, the design should reflect the whimsical, but ultimately little, challenge
            that is presented. It should be an exercise in restraint and character, and should require very little
            learning time.

    <h3>Related Products</h3>
    <div class="body_text">
        <p>Mobile phones have access to two main types of external content: mobile applications and web pages. Products
            resembling our design are found on the Internet or on the phone’s respective digital distribution platform
            (iOS App Store or Google Play).
        </p>

        <h4>Web based products</h4>
        <p>Several websites exist with the main purpose of distributing a “word of the day”. The main notification
            system that is used is an email subscription service.
            <a href="http://www.wordthink.com/">WordThink</a> provides a word of the day that is culturally significant.
            The words are taken from news articles and try not to be obscure or too pretentious. The word of the day and
            its definition can be viewed on the website’s front page or in the daily email notification. There is no
            example usage of the word or any information about the word’s etymology. The website styling is archaic and
            does not follow modern trends. Moreover, there is currently a link to a mobile application, but the link is
            invalid. Users must therefore check their emails or access the web page to view the provided new word.</p>

        <p><a href="http://wordsmith.org/awad/">Wordsmith</a> also provides a word of the day on its front page, but
            aims at ameliorating their users’ vocabulary. The words are fairly obscure and tend to be for experienced
            English speakers. Pronunciation, etymology and a usage example are also provided. Furthermore, the website’s
            main goal is to provide its online community interesting content related to linguistics. The website also
            offers other services, such as an anagram maker, a chat and a news site for anagrams. The main notification
            service is once again an email subscription service. The styling is archaic, but very simple and direct. The
            image below is a screen grab of the webpage. </p>

        <h4>Mobile applications</h4>
        <p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-word-of-the-day/id676595283?mt=8">The Word of the Day!</a> by
            Silvia Martinez and <a

            by Unity are mobile apps available on the iOS and Android app stores providing a mobile equivalent of the
            websites described above. Only the word’s definition is provided and a history of the past words seen by the
            user. The apps are directed towards English speakers wanting to enhance their vocabulary. The apps styling
            is simple and modern, providing very clear access to the app’s content.</p>

    <h3>Product Comparison</h3>
    <div class="body_text">
        <p>There are currently no products that perfectly satisfy our users’ needs. The applications and websites
            described in the previous section focus on providing the content, and not on interacting with the user. They
            are educational sources, in a sense, as they teach the user a new word. Our product’s goal is to encourage
            face-to-face conversations and lessen the strain of first encounters by providing icebreakers. It also
            records your progress by providing a tracking system and presents small rewards when a word or phrase is
            used during the day, such as tokens, badges and points. The proposed design is also more appealing to our
            target user base because of its modern styling and reward-based interactions. Social media provides direct
            feedback for most actions taken by users through the use of digital points (likes on Facebook, or karma on
            Reddit), and is heavily used by people in the 10-50 age group. Our notification system will alert users and
            remind them to interact with their surroundings; it does not require that users remember to check their
            emails or visit a specific web page. The target audience of our design is well accustomed to being notified
            on their smartphones and responding to these notifications. This is why we have chosen a mobile application
            with notifications and a reward-based interaction system.</p>

            and its infrastructure (server).

        </p>

        <h4>Custom Components</h4>
        <p>
            <b>Mobile app:</b> The mobile application will be cross-platform (Android and iOS). It will be created using
            existant frameworks such as ionic, nativescript or meteor, which allow for Web-based development of
            cross-platform applications.
            <br>
            <b>Local Database:</b> The local database will be used to store local data, such as word usage history
            or words for offline usage.
            <br>
            <b>Push Notification Service:</b> The push notification service will be used to notify a user about his
            "Daily Word Suggestion", or another such feature.
        </p>

        <h4>Existing Components</h4>
        <p>
            <b>Word Definition API:</b> This external API will be used to retrieve external words, their definition and
            other specifications, such as frequency of use and familiarity.
            <br>
            <b>Text to Voice API:</b> This external API will be used so that the user can hear the pronunciation of the
            proposed word.
        </p>

        <h4>Optional Components</h4>
        <p>
            <b>DB Server:</b> The database server can be used for multiple purpose and advanced functionalities. For
            example, to gather data regarding word usage, application usage, etc.
            <br>
            <b>REST API:</b> This API will be custom made using existing frameworks such as the Django REST Framework.
            It will be used to have access to data stored in the database over the Internet.

    <h3>Feasibility</h3>
    <div class="body_text">

        <p>First of all, here is the list of the team members' relevant skills:</p>

        <b>William Bouchard:</b> Android Development, Web Design (HTML, CSS), Graphic Design
        <br>
        <b>Olivier Eydt:</b> Mobile Development (Android & iOS), Web Design (HTML, CSS), Javascript, jQuery, AJAX, PHP,
        SQL
        <br>
        <b>Samuel Roux:</b> Database architecture, DJANGO REST Framework, Javascript, Web Design (HTML, CSS), Mobile
        Development (Android & iOS)<br>

        <p>In order to ensure the project feasibility, we have chosen a set of technologies that matches the variety of
            skills in our team and where every team member will be important to bring the project to an end.</p>

        <p>The mobile app development will be ensured by the skills of all team members combined, which already have
            experience in both Android and iOS. Also, in order to reduce development time and offer an app for both iOS
            and Android users, an existing cross-platform framework will be leveraged instead of developing two separate
            applications. This framework is based on web technologies, such as Javascript, HTML, and CSS, which can be
            easily used by our team.
        </p>

        <p>The local database portion of it can be easily managed by one of the team member by using a simple file
            based, embedded database.
        </p>

        <p>The push notification service will be implemented using the tools built-in the cross-platform framework.</p>

        <p>The integration with external services will be made simple, because the response is provided in JSON format,
            by doing a GET request. Again, any of our team members with web skills will be able to perform this.
        </p>

        <p>Also, the cloud component (Database server and REST API on top of it) has been made optional, because they
            are not necessary for the application to be running and tested by a human subject. Once we have a first
            working prototype, we will re-evaluate if it's possible to add it in. Based on the significant skills of the
            team in SQL, database and API design, implementing this could be challenging, but could be executed with
            proper time management.
        </p>

        <p>To ensure proper tracking of all items to be completed and their assignments, the GitHub Projects feature
            will be used. This will allow all developers to be on track and optimize efforts based on our individual
            skills.
        </p>

        <p>Finally, the main strategy to make this project feasible is to use everyone's skill effectively by using
            existing and known technologies that accelerate development and by doing proper task management.
        </p>
