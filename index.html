    <h2>Project Proposal</h2>

    <!-- Observe several users carrying out the activity you've chosen to focus on for your project. Describe your observations of these users as they carried out the specific activity. -->
    <!-- 5: Observations of three or more people, involving an activity of central importance to the proposed project. -->

    <h3>Observations</h3>

    <div class="body_text">
        <!-- Will-->
        <p>Three people sit at the dinner table to eat at the end of the day. While eating, everyone is using their
            smartphone — they are looking downwards toward their smartphone screen. One person has earphones on while
            watching a YouTube video. Another is looking at the day's e-mails and planifying their day for tomorrow. The
            third is reading articles. When asked questions, short and somewhat dismissive answers are given. Sometimes
            a person interrupts what they are doing to read and answer to a new message (Facebook, Snapchat, SMS). There
            is no conversation going on at the table, only occasional short questions and answers.
        </p>

        <!-- Sam-->
        <p>
            Two people are in the living room. Netflix is running, the dog is sleeping and humans are silent. One is
            watching Netflix while the other is reading some articles. Both subjects have their phone nearby ready for
            any alert. The subject reading article (Female) is often interrupted by the multiple group chat that are going on
            on multiple platforms (Messenger, SMS, Snapchat), those group chat are mostly for social purpose (not work or
            school related). The other one (Male) is mostly getting emails related to work and answer them right away.
            Once the individual activities are completed and they get into a suggestion together, the same scenario arise,
            as soon as they get an alert, they reply. The main difference is that after the reply, they don't stick to
            their smartphone to pursue other activities, they join back in the conversation.
        </p>

    <!-- Describe the interaction problem you observed or the opportunity for improved design that arises from your observations. Provide supporting material, e.g., brief and small file size video clips, photographs, or illustrations that demonstrate the interaction problem or an opportunity for improved design. -->
    <!-- 5: A relevant problem or opportunity for improved interaction was clearly identified, well explained, and illustrated by the supporting material. -->

    <h3>The Problem</h3>

    <div class="body_text">
        <p>As we observed, people tend to spend a great amount of time using their smartphones for socialization.
            Activities are varied: texting friends through SMS or iMessage, checking a Facebook feed, organizing a
            work-related e-mail inbox, or sending ephemeral messages through Snapchat. Even when in groups, with friends
            or family, while eating or just hanging out, people tend to confine themselves to their smartphones. </p>

        <!-- add picture of roomates/group on cellphone -->

        <p>Our observations suggest that this is due to the hard-to-resist pull of sheer information and total
            entertainment. This is in line with a recent study from the McCombs School of Business at The University of
            Texas at Austin, which reveals that the presence of person's smartphone nearby is enough to distract them
            and "reduce available cognitive capacity" [1]. </p>

        <p>The convenience of social interaction through a smartphone is also hard to match. Sending a message is quick
            and easy, compared to the effort required by a telephone call or a meeting in person. The entertainment
            value of the message can also be augmented by including a funny picture, a video, or a series of emojis --
            things that aren't available to rely on in conventional face-to-face interaction. A side-effect of the
            greatly facilitated communication brought by technology is that messages tend to be uniform and direct.
            Laughter is reduced to a few characters and jokes have trendy and easily-replicable formats. Many
            conversations are also results-focused -- for example, agreeing on quick meet-ups, or dry Slack chats. </p>

        <p>With this in mind, our goal is to add some variety to social interaction and encourage face-to-face
            conversation. Effectively, we want to create a smartphone application that deters users from excessive use
            of their smartphone for socialization. However, applications to prevent direct smartphone use already exist.
            Rather, we want to take a fun-centered approach. To do this, the application would suggest an uncommon word,
            a phrase, a question, a discussion topic, or other such facilitators to use in real-life conversation. </p>

        <p>The scope of the project is solely based on software development and design.
            Any hardware used is already existant and will be required to run the application (smartphone)
            and its infrastructure (server).

        </p>

        <h4>Custom Components:</h4>
        <p>
            <b>Mobile app:</b> The mobile application will be cross-platform (Android and iOS). It will be created using
            existant frameworks such as ionic, nativescript or meteor.
            <br><b>Local Database:</b> The local database will be used to store local data, such as word usage history
            or word for offline usage.
            <br><b>Push Notification Service:</b> The push notification service will be used to notify a user about his
            "Daily Word Suggestion"
        </p>

        <h4>Existing Components:</h4>

        <p>
            <b>Word Definition API:</b> This external API will be used to retrieve external words, their definition and
            other specifications, such as frequency of use and familiarity.
            <br><b>Text to Voice API:</b> This external API will be used so that the user can hear the pronunciation of
            the
            proposed word.
        </p>

        <h4>Optional Components:</h4>
        <p>
            <b>DB Server:</b> The database server can be used for multiple purpose and advanced functionalities. For
            example, to gather data regarding word usage, application usage, etc..
            <br><b>REST API:</b> This API will be custom made using existing frameworks such as the Django REST
            Framework. It will be used to have access to data stored in the database.
        </p>

    <h3>Feasibility</h3>

    <div class="body_text">

        <p>First of all here is the list of the team members relevant skills.</p>

        <b>William Bouchard:</b> Android Development, Web Design (HTML, CSS) <br>
        <b>Olivier Eydt:</b> Mobile Development (Android & iOS), Web Design (HTML, CSS), Javascript, jQuery, aJax, PHP,
        sql<br>
        <b>Samuel Roux:</b> Database architecture, DJANGO REST Framework, Javascript, Web Design (HTML, CSS), Mobile
        Development (Android & iOS)<br>

        <p>
            In order to ensure the project feasibility, we have chosen a set of technologies that matches the variety of
            skills in our team and where every team member will be important to bring the project to an end.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mobile app development will be ensure by the skills of all team members combined, which already got
            experience in both Android and iOS. Also, in order to reduce development time and offer an app for both iOS
            and Android users, an existing cross-platform framework will be leverage instead of developing two separate
            applications. This framework is based on web technologies, such as Javascript, HTML, CSS, which can be
            easily used by our team.
        </p>

        <p>
            The local database portion of it can be easily manage by one of the team member by using a simple file
            based,
            embeded database.
        </p>

        <p>
            The push notification service will be implemented using the tools built-in the cross-platform framework.
        </p>

        <p>
            The integration with external services will be made simple, because the response is provided in JSON format,
            by doing a GET request. Again, any of our team member with web skills will be able to perform this.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, the cloud component (Database server and REST API on top of it) has been made optional, because
            they are not necessary for the application to be running and test by human subject, but once we have a first
            working prototype, we will re-evaluate if it's possible to add it in. Based on the significant skills of the
            team in SQL, database and API design, implementing this could be challenging, but could be executed with
            proper time management.
        </p>

        <p>
            To ensure proper tracking of all items to be completed and their assignments, the GitHub Projects feature
            will be used.
            This will allow all developers to be on track and optimize efforts based on our individual skills.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, the main strategy to make this project feasible is to use everyone's skill effectively by using
            existing and known technologies that accelerate development and by doing proper task management.
        </p>
