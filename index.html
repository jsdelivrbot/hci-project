	<h2>Project Proposal</h2>

	<!-- Observe several users carrying out the activity you've chosen to focus on for your project. Describe your observations of these users as they carried out the specific activity. -->
	<!-- 5: Observations of three or more people, involving an activity of central importance to the proposed project. -->

	<h3>Observations</h3>

	<div class="body_text">
		<p>Three people sit at the dinner table to eat at the end of the day. While eating, everyone is using their smartphone — they are looking downwards toward their smartphone screen. One person has earphones on while watching a YouTube video. Another is looking at the day's e-mails and planifying their day for tomorrow. The third is reading articles. When asked questions, short and somewhat dismissive answers are given. Sometimes a person interrupts what they are doing to read and answer to a new message (Facebook, Snapchat, SMS). There is no conversation going on at the table, only occasional short questions and answers. </p>
	</div>

	<!-- Describe the interaction problem you observed or the opportunity for improved design that arises from your observations. Provide supporting material, e.g., brief and small file size video clips, photographs, or illustrations that demonstrate the interaction problem or an opportunity for improved design. -->
	<!-- 5: A relevant problem or opportunity for improved interaction was clearly identified, well explained, and illustrated by the supporting material. -->

	<h3>The Problem</h3>

	<div class="body_text">
		<p>As we observed, people tend to spend a great amount of time using their smartphones for socialization. Activities are varied: texting friends through SMS or iMessage, checking a Facebook feed, organizing a work-related e-mail inbox, or sending ephemeral messages through Snapchat. Even when in groups, with friends or family, while eating or just hanging out, people tend to confine themselves to their smartphones. </p>

		<!-- add picture of roomates/group on cellphone -->

		<p>Our observations suggest that this is due to the hard-to-resist pull of sheer information and total entertainment. This is in line with a recent study from the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin, which reveals that the presence of person's smartphone nearby is enough to distract them and "reduce available cognitive capacity" [1]. </p>

		<p>The convenience of social interaction through a smartphone is also hard to match. Sending a message is quick and easy, compared to the effort required by a telephone call or a meeting in person. The entertainment value of the message can also be augmented by including a funny picture, a video, or a series of emojis -- things that aren't available to rely on in conventional face-to-face interaction. A side-effect of the greatly facilitated communication brought by technology is that messages tend to be uniform and direct. Laughter is reduced to a few characters and jokes have trendy and easily-replicable formats. Many conversations are also results-focused -- for example, agreeing on quick meet-ups, or dry Slack chats. </p>

		<p>With this in mind, our goal is to add some variety to social interaction and encourage face-to-face conversation. Effectively, we want to create a smartphone application that deters users from excessive use of their smartphone for socialization. However, applications to prevent direct smartphone use already exist. Rather, we want to take a fun-centered approach. To do this, the application would suggest an uncommon word, a phrase, a question, a discussion topic, or other such facilitators to use in real-life conversation. </p>
